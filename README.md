## Data Source

We are using the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data from 2022 for our project. The data can be found at [https://nhts.ornl.gov/downloads](https://nhts.ornl.gov/downloads) and the data dictionary can be found at [https://nhts.ornl.gov/documentation](https://nhts.ornl.gov/documentation).

## Repo Organization

The repo is organized as follows:

* `data/` contains our data as well as the documentation for the data. It contains two subfolders:
    * `raw/`, which contains the raw data, and
    * `clean/`, which contains the cleaned data.
* `code/` contains all of our code for the project. It is further organized into subfolders based on the type of code/phase of the project.
