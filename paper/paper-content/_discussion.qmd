## Discussion

Among all the models considered, XGBoost stands out as the best performer, followed closely by Random Forest. Both XGBoost and Random Forest are ensemble methods that have the ability to achieve low variance and bias by leveraging weak estimators to build strong classifiers. However, XGBoost exhibits certain advantages over Random Forest. XGBoost incorporates a gradient boosting framework that enables it to handle more complex relationships within the data. This allows XGBoost to learn complex patterns and interactions within the data and achieves a better predictive performance.

Neural networks also have the potential to capture complex patterns within the data. However, they come with a trade-off in terms of their computational intensity. Neural networks require significant computational resources and time to train, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex architectures.

SVM and logistic regression, while being widely used classification algorithms, did not perform as well in this context. The complexity of the underlying data seems to pose a challenge for these models. SVM relies on finding optimal hyperplanes to separate data points, and logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. These assumptions may not hold true for the given dataset based on the result.

One notable advantage of XGBoost and Random Forest is their interpretability, or XAI (explainable artificial intelligence). These models provide insights into feature importance, allowing us to understand the factors driving the estimation of travel purposes. From the analysis, it is evident that the "reason_for_travel" and "time_at_destination" features hold the most significant importance in estimating the travel purpose. This aligns with our intuition as these features likely contain patterns that strongly correlate with determining the travel purpose. That being said, the features were checked against trip_purpose for multicollinearity and none was found. It is important to note that while the feature names trip_purpose and reason_for_trip sound similar, they are measuring different things. For example, "Buy meals" appears frequently in the reason_for_travel feature, but it appears in home based shopping, social and recreational, and not home based shopping. In contrast, interpreting neural network models and SVMs can be challenging due to their more complex internal workings and lack of feature importance measures.
