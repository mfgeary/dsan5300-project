## Methods

### Data

As a federally funded agency, the Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration seeks to understand how Americans are using the national highway system. Since 1969, the FHA has regularly conducted the National Highway Travel Survey (NHTS) in order to collect detailed data on the travel habits of Americans and their usage of federal transit networks [@userguide]. From January 2022 through January 2023, the FHA conducted the 2022 NHTS, receiving responses from 7,XXX households [@website]. Survey data includes in-depth information regarding each household member's travel habits across the past 30 days, detailing individual demographic information; household-level demographic information; purpose, location, duration, and mode of transportation for recent travel; and vehicle information [@datadictionary].

For our research, we chose to utilize the individual demographic information, called the `person` data, along with the trip specific data, called the `trip` data. These two data sources contained XX predictors that were unique for each observation. We selected these table because 1) XX predictors was more than sufficient for modeling, and 2) the household and vehicle level data was shared across different observation, creating potential obfuscation in modeling. The final joined data set of `person` and `trip` data contained XXXX observations and XX features, including one target variable.

### Preprocessing

To prepare the data for modeling, we conducting a thorough cleansing process that included creating human-readable variable names and removing missing or incomplete observations. The final data set was a joined combination between person-level data and trip-level data. After joining, all unique identifier variables and flag variables were removed from the data.

Next, a correlation analysis was conducted to prevent autocorrelation or multicollinearity between variables. An analysis revealed that three variables had correlations over 0.2 with the target variable and were somewhat related in content to the target variable (>0.2). In order to build a more robust model, these three variables, `why_trip`, `trip_purpose_old_schema`, and `reason_for_travel_to` were removed.

Our target variable had five classes for categorizing the purpose of trips. We assessed the balance of the classes in order to ensure our final model would be unbiased. Seven observations with no data for the target variables were omitted.

An analysis of the target variable support shows that the classes are fairly balanced. While there is a distinction between the class sizes, each class has a significantly large sample size to create a fairly unbiased model. Modeling will be assess using balanced metrics in order to verify that final results remain unbiased by class imbalance.

For all modeling, numerical predictors were scaled and centered to normalize predictive influence. Categorical predictors were one-hot encoded, generating binary nomial predictors for each class level.

### Statistical Modeling

In order to predict trip purpose using NHTS data, we trained and assessed five different statistical learning model architectures. We aimed to establish a base line model and then test various methods in order to improve the predictive power of the statistical learning. Our goal was to achieve a high predictive accuracy and a high ROC AUC score, creating a model with strong predictive power and balanced results.
