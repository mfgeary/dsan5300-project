## Results

We observe that the XGBoost machine learning algorithm performed the best with a test accuracy of 82.17% followed by a Random Forest model which had an accuracy of 73.22%. A neural network model was also fit to the data but it only resulted in an accuracy of 59.88%, followed by Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression which had accuracy rates of 51.21% and 45.67%.

We also observed the ROC AUC curve to be the greatest for XGBoost model-0.97, followed by Random Forest which had the ROC AUC curve of 0.93. Overall, XGBoost model performed the best out of all the five models that were trained on the data.
